		It all started with David Keirsey (1921 - 2013), who made the study about four temperaments popular again. In his book "Please Understand Me", he focused on "describing observable behavior".<br/>
		4 Fundamental Temperaments, according to David Keirsey:<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>Artisan</b> - Dionysian (SP)<br/>
		<b>Idealist</b> - Apollonian (NF)<br/>
		<b>Rational</b> - Promethean (NT)<br/>
		<b>Guardian</b> - Epimethean (SJ)<br/>
		<br/>

		Don Lowry presented Keirsey's study to public (1979) "by means of theater productions", where the colors were used to describe the basic personality types.<br/>
		<b>Orange</b> (SP)<br/>
		<b>Blue</b> (NF)<br/>
		<b>Green</b> (NT)<br/>
		<b>Gold </b>(SJ)<br/></p>

		After analyzing participant responses Mary Miscisin and Ed Redard determined "how the characteristics of each of the four basic personality styles affect a person's well-being" (1995). Six years later Mary Miscin published the book "Showing our True Colors" which reflected the True Colors concept of Don Lowry. After 20 years of research Mary published all her findings, and this study helped people understand their values and needs. In 2014, descriptor terms were introduced for the four basic personality types.<br/>
		<b>Mover</b> (SP - Orange)<br/>
		<b>Connector</b> (NF - Blue)<br/>
		<b>Thinker</b> (NT - Green)<br/>
		<b>Planner</b> (SJ - Gold)<br/>

		<i>Planner</i><br/>
			<ul>
				<li>Organized, prepared, dependable</li>
				<li>Seeks order and fairness</li>
				<li>Carves consistency and things in their place</li>
			</ul>

		<i>Thinker</i><br/>
			<ul>
				<li>Curious, logical, self-sufficient</li>
				<li>Seeks clarity and knowledge</li>
				<li>Prefers to make calculated decisions</li>
			</ul>
		Thinkers are always thirsty for knowledge and to quench this feeling <i>return gift;</i> provides a wide range of educational books. For example: How the Internet Works, Glad You Asked, Science Project Puzzlers, and etc.<br/><br/>

		<i>Mover</i><br/>
			<ul>
				<li>Courageous, exploratory, playful</li>
				<li>Seeks action and adventure</li>
				<li>Carves variety and enjoys improvising</li>
			</ul>
		Movers love exploring the world around themselves, so a telescope or binoculars can come in handy. As the name suggests, this type of people can also be interested in camping, and therefore we added camping equipment to the merchandise database.<br/><br/>
		<i>Connector</i><br/>
		<ul>
			<li>Considerate, cooperative, encouraging</li>
			<li>Seeks harmony and personal connection</li>
			<li>Prefers to make decisions that feel good</li>
		</ul>
		These people always seek liberation and peace, and one way to reach it is a well-known yoga; thus, tapestries and mandalas are must-haves for connectors. Among other gift ideas are canvases, accessories, and DVDs with relaxing music.<br/><br/>
